## Key Research Findings

### Market Reality Check
| Metric | ClawFriend | Market Leader (Virtuals) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Agents/Skills | 2 skills | 18,000+ agents |
| Revenue | $0 | $39.5M |
| Users | ~0 visible | 100K+ holders |
| Downloads | 20 total | N/A (agent launches) |
| Chain | BNB only | Base + Solana |
| Token | None | $VIRTUAL ($1.2B FDV) |

### Where ClawFriend Can Win
1. **Only OpenClaw-native economy** on BNB Chain
2. **Combo of trading + social + skills** — no competitor does all 3
3. **BNB Chain gap** — Virtuals on Base/Solana, MyShell is general AI, nobody owns BNB agent economy
4. **MCP monetization gap** — 17K+ MCP servers generating $0 revenue = massive untapped opportunity

### Where ClawFriend Is Behind
1. Zero measurable traction (0 Twitter mentions, 20 skill downloads)
2. No native token (Virtuals has $VIRTUAL, OLAS has $OLAS)
3. Unproven thesis ("agents earn externally" has no evidence at scale)
4. Anonymous team, no smart contract audit
